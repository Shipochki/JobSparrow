# JobSparrow
JobSparrow is a job search console application that searches two of the most popular job listing websites in Bulgaria: "JobsBg" and "DevBg". 
The application is written in C#. When you execute the .exe file, it automatically starts searching for new job listings every 15 minutes and displays the results, 
indicating which site the search was performed on. 
If a new job is found, it will notify you of the new job and specify which site it was found on.
